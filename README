= Molecule

Libraries of molecules ready for mass, abundance, and isotope calculations.  

== Description
Molecule provides a way to specify molecules by formula and perform common calculations therefrom, such as calculating mass.  Molecule was developed for use in mass spectrometry of proteins where high mass accuracy and sensitivity to isotope abundance is required, and has special functionality for the proteomics field.  The fundamental library is general and easily adaptable to other projects.

== Usage

  require 'molecule'
  include Molecule
  
  # Definition of a molecule
  water = Formula.new("H2O")
  water.mass            # => 18.0105646
  
  # Molecule predfines a library for Amino Acid residues
  a = Residue::A
  a.name                 # => "Alanine"
  a.abbr                  # => "Ala"
  a.formula              # => "C3H5NO"
  
  # A smorgasbord of lookup methods
  a == Residue.A                             # => true
  a == Residue.a                             # => true
  a == Residue.ala                          # => true
  a == Residue.alanine                    # => true

== Installation

Molecule is available as a gem on RubyForge[http://rubyforge.org/projects/bioactive].  Use:

  % gem install molecule

== Element Data

Element isotope, mass, and abundance information was obtained from the NIST {Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions}[http://www.physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Compositions/index.html] reference.  All isotopes with a non-nil isotopic composition (ie relative abundance) were compiled from this {view}[http://www.physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl?ele=&all=all&ascii=ascii2&isotype=all] on 2008-01-22.
