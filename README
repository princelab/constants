= Constants

Libraries of physical and chemical constants for scientific calculations in Ruby.

== Description

Constants provides libraries of constant values (such as the precise mass of carbon 13, or the 
spin of a strange quark).  Additionally provides the Constants::Library module to facilitate
easy, flexible lookup of constants.  

I have attempted to use reputable sources for the constants data.  Please notify me of any 
errors and send me suggestions for other constants to include.

== Usage

  require 'constants'
  include Constants::Libraries
  
  # Element predefines all chemical elements
  c = Element::C
  c.name                 # => "Carbon"
  c.symbol               # => "C"
  c.atomic_number        # => 6
  c.mass(12)             # => 12.0
  c.mass(13)             # => 13.0033548378
  
  # A smorgasbord of lookups methods
  c == Element['Carbon']         # => true
  c == Element['C']              # => true
  c == Element[6]                # => true
  
== Installation

Constants is available as a gem through GitHub[http://github.com/bahuvrihi/constants/tree/master].  Use:

  % gem install constants --source=http://gems.github.com/

= Data Sources

=== Element Data

Element isotope, mass, and abundance information was obtained from the NIST {Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions}[http://www.physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Compositions/index.html] reference.  All isotopes 
with a non-nil isotopic composition (ie relative abundance) were compiled from this {view}[http://www.physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl?ele=&all=all&ascii=ascii2&isotype=all] 
on 2008-01-22. 

=== Physical Constant Data

The physical constant data is assembled from the NIST {Fundamental Physical Constants}[http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/Table/allascii.txt]
on 2008-04-28.

=== Particle Data

Particle data was assembled from a non-ideal source, wikipedia[http://www.wikipedia.org/], and will remain
so until I have time to update it with something better.
